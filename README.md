# RHG

In this repository, you will find all my codes used during my internship on Random Hyberbolic Graphs under the direction of Dieter Mitsche (Universit√© de Nice). 

To install properly the files on your device, please do the following:
1. create a main folder (ex: /Users/abarrier/Desktop/RHG),
2. create a folder "python" in the main folder and put all the .py files on it, 
3. on each .py file (except RHG_functions.py), replace the #TODO at the beginnning of the file by the path of the main folder (ex: "/Users/abarrier/Desktop/RHG")

You can now run all codes. If some figures are saved, all folders and files will be generated automatically. 

Concerning the .py files:
- RHG_functions.py countain all the functions used in other files. You do not have to use it. 
- RHG.py allow to do basic simulations (generation and simulation of a push & pull proppagation) on RHG. 
- RHG_layrs.py is similar as RHG.py but is specific to what we call RHG in layers (see the report). 
- RHG_simulations.py is the code used to generate most of the figures of the report. You can generate them by yourself.
